What is Java ?
---------------------------
- Java forms part of Back-End Web development.
- Java is widely-used, general-purpose, class-based, and object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.
- <b>Java Runtime Environment (JRE)</b> for operation. This component enables your computer to run Java programs.
- <b>Java Development Kit (JDK)</b> for crafting and compiling Java programs, bundled with the JRE and handy compilers and tools. <b>WITH JDK INSTALLATION, THE JRE COMES ALONG WITH IT</b>
- In Java, "compile" refers to the process of converting the source code written in Java into bytecode that can be executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This process involves several steps and is carried out by the Java compiler, which is part of the Java Development Kit (JDK).
