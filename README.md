# Intro-to-Java

What is Java ?
---------------------------
- Java forms part of Back-End Web development.
- Java is widely-used, general-purpose, class-based, and object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.
- <b>Java Runtime Environment (JRE)</b> for operation. This component enables your computer to run Java programs.
- <b>Java Development Kit (JDK)</b> for crafting and compiling Java programs, bundled with the JRE and handy compilers and tools. <b>WITH JDK INSTALLATION, THE JRE COMES ALONG WITH IT</b>
- In Java, "compile" refers to the process of converting the source code written in Java into bytecode that can be executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This process involves several steps and is carried out by the Java compiler, which is part of the Java Development Kit (JDK).

Java Variables
-------------------------
- <b>Dynamically Typed</b> - Variable types are determined at runtime through context in the code.
- <b>Statically Typed</b> - Variables types must be declared before the program can be compiled.

Declaring a variable 
-------------------------
eg. var isWaterWet = true;
    int five;

Decision Structures in Java
--------------------------------
- if statements - The if statement works like a side road in the program. If a certain situation happens, the program takes that side road and executes a certain block of code, then it goes back to the main path of execution.

- If-else Statements - The if-else statement is a decision structure that allows a program to take one of two paths, depending on whether a certain condition is met.

- If-Else-If Statements - The if-else-if statement is a versatile tool that can be used to control the flow of a program. It can be used to execute different code blocks based on multiple conditions.
